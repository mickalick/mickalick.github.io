                    <h3>UX Design Case Study</h3>
                    <p>In my time working at Huntington National Bank, I was fully dedicated to the conception and launch of a new to bank application that supports the sales and onboarding of business and commercial customers, including prospective customers, to the bank.</p>
                    <p>As part of this platform, a key feature defined was the need for an in-application messaging solution, as a means to help replace email communication happening between customers and Huntington colleagues today.</p>
                    <p>As the lead interaction designer on the project, I was responsible for collaborating across multiple areas of the bank to design a viable solution that would meet the needs of the business and its customers alike. Here's how we did it.</p>

                <h2 align="center">The Challenge</h2>
                <p>As part of current onboarding processes, both our customers and the internal colleagues who support them were heavily reliant on email communication to exchange information and correspondence regarding their account opening or deal originations. The business was motivated to bring this kind of communication into the application itself, thus the "In-App Messaging" feature was started.</p>

                <h2 align="center">Understanding & Analysis</h2>
                <p>By this point in the maturity of our design team, we had established a cadence of "understanding" sessions with business and product partners to help narrow our focus on the story of each upcoming feature, their goals as the business, the needs for our customers, as well as any assumptions we might be making.</p>
                <p>Following one of these sessions on this feature, I immediately set out on collecting as many examples of online messaging systems that I could find. With this exercise, I documented the commonalities we saw across the current Huntington ecosystem, as well as with competitors and non-banking experiences alike, and came away with inspiration on the many possible paths forward.</p>
                <p class="workLabel center">We looked at messaging experiences across 20 different examples</p>

                <h2 align="center">Approach & Explorations</h2>
                <p>I started by listing out the high-level use cases and scenarios that both colleagues and customers could experience using such a solution, and validated with the business which were relevant for our first iteration, and those that could be saved for future versions.</p>
                <p>From there, I explored the various entry point and navigation models that could result from adding messaging into our existing application, and listed out the pros and cons associated with each, taking those into conversations with the business to help further align and narrow down our approach. While these conversations and decisions were in flux, I continued to explore where I could, putting together object models and concepts that fit within the parameters we had defined to that point.</p>

                <h2 align="center">Tech & Architecture Discussions</h2>
                <p>After creating and aligning on initial concepts, we took our ideas to our technical and architecture partners to discuss feasibility and constraints.</p>
                <p>It was important to use a solution and framework that our colleagues would use and understand, while not requiring a lot of custom coding or overly intricate technical design. With their expertise and support, the team was able to align on a few possible approaches, and after thoroughly vetting each, landed on a solution aligning with the framework developed for our "Tasks" area of the application.</p>
                <p class="workLabel center">Our defined "approaches" that were used to help inform the tech design</p>

                <h2 align="center">Refinement & Feedback</h2>
                <p>With the backend figured out, we were now able to narrow down some of the more minute details of the interactions and behaviors of the customer-facing experience. Over the course of many collaborative discussions involving BSAs, technical leads, and product partners, we were able to determine specifics such as message character limits, conversation states and statuses, retention limits, and more.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, working with the researchers on my design team, we developed a rapid usability study using UserTesting.com to help understand where users may run into pain points with the experience. I created a highly interactive prototype of the interface, and helped narrow down the question set to the areas we wished to focus on.</p>
                <p>Upon launching and getting results on the study, we found that our only major area of concern was around the "archive" functionality. What we learned was that users interpreted the word "archive" differently from how we were presenting it. To mitigate this, we regrouped as a team and quickly pivoted to a secondary concept of "hiding" message conversations, which allowed for the same functionality as archiving without the confusion on what would occur when enacted.</p>

                <p>With the technical specifics determined and user feedback addressed, all that was left was to create the final deliverable and specifications for our development partners. Though I was primarily responsible for creating the wireframes and subsequent annotations, it was also my responsibility to help communicate my designs to the various stakeholders and teams impacted by this feature, including to our internal design leaders as well as various business SMEs and representatives.</p>
                <p>As the wireframes were finalized, I additionally helped coordinate and assist with the creation of our visual and content design deliverables, ensuring a consistent direction for both in alignment with my wireframes.</p>

                <p>With In-App Messaging slated for a Q2 2025 launch, the entirety of our design deliverables were completed by the end of January. As of February 2025 I am no longer with Huntington, but the project was left in extremely capable hands. I'm eager to hear about the progress of this feature, and excited for reports on when it officially goes live!</p>
