                    <h3>Project Overview</h3>
                    <p>In my time working at Huntington National Bank, I was fully dedicated to the conception and launch of a new to bank application that supports the sales and onboarding of business and commercial customers, including prospective customers, to the bank. The name for this project would come to be known as the "Digital Lobby", and would grow to be one of the largest initiatives at the bank in my time there.</p>
                    <p>As the lead interaction designer for the project, I was responsible for collaborating across multiple areas of the business, between product partners, process SMEs, architecture, and various technical teams, to design viable solutions that would meet the needs of the business, its customers, and the colleagues that support them. Here's how I did it.</p>

                <h2 align="center">Understanding the Problem</h2>
                <p>A need was identified in the commercial and business banking areas of the bank to create a more seamless and efficient onboarding process for prospective customers to open and action on their accounts. The process at the time was filled with pain points around miscommunmications, duplicate document requests, and an overall lack of clarity.</p>
                <p>Prior to me joining the project, a strategy was developed to create a secure portal for prospective and active customers alike to interact with their Huntington team over key moments of their journey. Once I came aboard, we immediately started into delivering solutions based on this vision.</p>

                <h2 align="center">Enrollment & Login</h2>
                <p>The first challenge to solve was how to get users into the application. Working across various technical and regulatory teams, I developed flows and wireframes that fit our authentication standards at the bank and allowed for prospective customers to create an online account for the first time in a Huntington ecosystem.</p>

                <h2 align="center">Document Collection</h2>
                <p>Once the user was in the application, how would they interact with it? The initial use case for this portal revolved around document collection, but was set to evolve over time with new needs from various areas of the bank, so the solution needed to be generic and flexible.</p>
                <p>After some initial competitive analysis and exploration on document collection models, we decided to test two different concepts with users. What we found and went forward with was an approach we called the "To-Do prototype", where a user would interact and go through various "tasks" assigned to them, leading to a flow of whatever is needed.</p>

                <p>With our interface defined, it was then time to create the flows and interactions for the initial set of tasks.</p>
                <p>Our first area to concentrate on was the regulatory onboarding journey, where prospective customers would submit documents, fill out forms, and sign agreements. We created a set of task flows following a templated approach for document uploading, as well as developed the needed forms and esignature capabilities.</p>

                <p>Once we defined and created the tasks for the onboarding journey, the project then expanded to include tasks needed for originating various loan and lending products.</p>
                <p>This expansion included new resources on my UX project team, as well as new external partners to collaborate with. With this increase in personnel, so to did our expectations increase for both the speed and quality of our deliverables.</p>
                <p>With the flexibility of my initial solution, the tasks for lending specific needs were able to fit into the existing model, with minor updates such as new filters and permission settings for different user roles.</p>

                <h2 align="center">Notifications</h2>
                <p>Following the addition of lending tasks, the business desired a more clear and upfront system of notifying the user of changes and updates happening within their lobby application. The feature, aptly named "In-App Notifications", was passed off to me to help design an optimal experience for what the business desired.</p>
                <p>We explored various options for implementing notifications, but ultimately landed on a solution we called the "popover" panel, which displayed any unread updates related to the user's account.</p>

                <p>To increase user control and freedom with their application, the next update would feature the ability for customers to reassign tasks to other contacts, as well as the ability to archive certain tasks to a less active area of the lobby. I lead the design efforts for both of these enhancements.</p>

                <p>As part of my final work on this project, I would lead design efforts on adding a messaging feature into the lobby application. This would help reduce existing reliance on less secure communication methods, such as email or phone messaging.</p>

                <p>The Huntington Digital Lobby officially launched as a pilot product in July 2022, starting off with just five users. By the end of 2024, the Lobby had grown to have over <em>1700 users</em>, including <em>10,000+ logins</em> and over <em>7500 tasks submitted</em> across various company profiles.</p>
                <p>As of February 2025, I am no longer with Huntington, but the project was left in capable hands going forward. I'm very grateful to have had the opportunity to impact such a key piece of Huntington's digital strategy, and am eager to hear how the application continues to evolve!</p>
