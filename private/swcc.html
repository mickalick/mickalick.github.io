                    <p>From September 2019 to October 2020, I worked in a contractor role with Sherwin-Williams where I was fully dedicated to the conception and launch of a new suite of B2B applications supporting their automotive collision repair customers.</p>
                    <p>As a UX designer on the project, I assisted with user research efforts, contributed to product strategy and roadmaps, collaborated with external vendors, and lead front-end design efforts on multiple customer-facing applications.</p>
                    <p>Here's a look at some of what I accomplished.</p>

                <h2 align="center">Research & Understanding</h2>
                <p>Upon joining the team, I was immediately involved in research efforts to help uncover aspects of the "automotive job journey" - that being the process and touchpoints of the average automotive collision repair job.</p>
                <p>From traveling to various independent repair shops as well as Sherwin-owned automotive storefronts across the region, we interviewed and observed the colleagues, customers, and would-be users of what we'd be designing.</p>
                <p>What we uncovered helped us piece together a comprehensive journey map of the collision repair process, as well as defined the various roles and persona types we would need to account for. This work was also critical in unveiling the top pain points, helping us influence the priorities and roadmap for the project.</p>

                <h2 align="center">Vendor Collaboration & Recommendations</h2>
                <p>Considering the various areas of the journey that Sherwin-Williams could directly impact, the team set out on determining what products and technology existed in the marketplace that could potentially be leveraged for our needs.</p>
                <p>Over the first half of the year we connected and collaborated with multiple vendors across the automotive repair landscape, landing on four to move forward with. For each solution, I collaborated wtih external partners on UI and style guides, as well as interaction recommendations to better match our user's expectations.</p>

                <h2 align="center">Mobile & Web App Design</h2>
                <p>When it came to our solution for the Inventory Management application, we knew we needed an experience that could not only be tailored to our brand, but also work within existing processes as well. We identified a vendor with a workable solution, but we went the extra mile and came to an agreement on building a native mobile application from the ground up.</p>
                <p>Over the course of just three months, I lead design efforts on the complete end-to-end workflow of the Collision Core Inventory application; from defining user flows and app architecture, to delivering pixel perfect visual mockups of the final interfaces.</p>
                <p>In addition, I also lead efforts to redesign the vendor's existing web application solution. This involved a complete UI audit and overhaul, restructuring and relabeling the navigation, and ensuring web interactions matched up across the mobile experience.</p>

                <h2 align="center">Impact & Status</h2>
                <p>Though I stepped away from Sherwin-Williams in October 2020, the project was left in great hands. The team went on to launch Collision Core Inventory, along with other applications in the Collision Core suite, through the end of 2020 and into the following year. As of May 2025, the Collision Core Inventory application has over 1,000 downloads in the Google Play store with an average rating of 4.4 stars; additionally the Apple store version has a rating of 5 stars.</p>
                <p>The Collision Core suite continues to evolve and be a key part of the automotive strategy at Sherwin-Williams going forward. I'm grateful to have had the opportunity to impact such an important initiative at the company.</p>
