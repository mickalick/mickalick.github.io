                    <p>SelectCheckout<sup>SM</sup> is a capability offered by Alliance Data to help improve the online shopping experience for our brands and their customers alike.

                <h2 align="center">The Challenge</h2>
                <p>The Mobile app team took initiative and developed an application with baseline functionality as a proof of concept for SelectCheckout. Though the app was a good starting point, it was missing vital features such as rewards integration, profile registration, and "remember me" functionality. It was also developed without any input from the UX team. My job was to refine the experience of the current state while also designing the features to be added in the future.</p>

                <h2 align="center">User Flows</h2>
                <p>Following competitve market research, I created scenario flows for all of the possible steps and actions a user needs to take to reset their password. These also included scenarios for the "Out of Band" process (i.e. user needs to confirm their identity due to a new sign-in device), as the two processes have a lot of overlap.</p>

                <h2 align="center">Early Engagement Wireframes & Mockups</h2>
                <p>The project work was split into separate "bundles", as the development estimates for each feature were large enough to be considered their own separate projects. Fortunately I started working on the design work for each feature six months before any development was scheduled to start. After competitive analysis and brainstorming solutions, I created low-fidelity mockups to be used in the business case proposals for each feature.</p>

                <h2 align="center">UI Redesign</h2>
                <p>With a better idea of the future state, I began working on redesigning the user interface of the application. I aimed to bring the look and feel of the experience closer to our established Account Center conventions, as the two capabilities use the same account credentials. I also created more opportunities for branding & marketing messaging.</p>

                <h2 align="center">Prototyping & Usability Testing</h2>
                <p>I prototyped and tested each new feature on its own to ensure we were meeting user's expectations. After ironing out some minor issues, it was time to test the entire experience from end to end. Due to the significance of this testing, we recruited help from the firm Lextant to conduct a large scale usability study. For this, I created a funtioning faux shopping website with the SelectCheckout integrated into it. The site was tested on both desktop and mobile platforms over 12 separate sessions, all conducted in Lextant's offsite usability lab.</p>

                <p>With testing complete, all that was left to do was document and develop it. I created a total of four specification documents, one for each new feature and one for the updated front-end design. I continued to support the project through handoff to the agile development team, making needed UX updates based on dev findings.</p>
